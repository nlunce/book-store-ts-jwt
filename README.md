# Overview

In my pursuit of continuous learning as a software engineer, I have developed a software project with the aim of enhancing my skills and knowledge. The software I've created serves as a practical application of what I've learned and showcases my ability to build a functional system.

## Description

I implemented JSON web token persistent authorization on my bookstore website by utilizing AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB.

## Purpose

The primary purpose behind creating this software is to establish a user-centric and efficient events website. Through this platform, users can browse an extensive catalog of events, access detailed information about each event, and create or edit events.

# Useful Websites

Throughout the project, I found the following websites to be helpful in gaining knowledge, troubleshooting issues, and improving my development skills:

- [React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux) - Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/): Dive in and learn React.js from scratch! Learn React, Hooks, Redux, React Router, Next.js, Best Practices and way more!
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org): A comprehensive resource for web development documentation and tutorials.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com): A valuable community where I found answers to various technical questions.

# Future Work

- Add JWT persistent authorization and have protected routes
- Connect a Cognito user pool
